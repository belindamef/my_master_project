## General Info 
This repository contains all scripts and tools for my master project.

In my master project I am investigating human sequential decision making in an exploration-exploitation dilemma.

For this I designed a [spatial search task](#spatial_search_task)) and developed a set of probabilistic agent-based [behavioural models](#behavioural_models) to compare different decision making strategies that participants may use for the task. This set includes explorative and exploitative Bayesian agents as well as control agents.

All scripts and tools I used for [simulations](#simulations) of agent-task-interactions and [data analyses](#data_analyses) are stored in this repository.
