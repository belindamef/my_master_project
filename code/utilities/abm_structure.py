# This class definition file enables the Matlab structure-like use of Python
# objects.
#
#   Objects of type abm_structure are initialized by
#       S       = AbmStructure()
#
#   Attributes of abm_structure type objects can be set as
#       S.att   = 'Hello world'
#
#   During interactive debugging, fields and values can be looked up by
#       S.__dict__
